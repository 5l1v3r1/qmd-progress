  Glossary for the code 
  ======================

  Please see variable_names for a full list of how to name variables. 
   
##  Some useful tips for naming variables: ##

- Avoid UPPER CASE unless it is really necessary. 
- Use _ symbol for naming variables that are used internally (eg: this_variable)
- Use combination of upper and lower case for input and output variables (eg: ThisVariable)
- AVOID using a single letter such as "r", "m" etc unless is really particular and private.
